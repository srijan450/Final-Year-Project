# Driver Drowsiness Detection System 
> Implemented the ML and computer vision techniques to implement the driver drowsiness detection system. The system uses har cascade files to detect the eye and mouth curvature points and continuously monitors the distance between these points. If the distance is less than the threshold the system raises the alarm.
